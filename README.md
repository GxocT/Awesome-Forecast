# AW Forecast
## Task
Prototype for a location based weather application that reports the weather local to the user. The application must:
* Has Tab bar with 2 elements: Weekly Forecast, and Today Forecast
* Weekly Forecast shows the 5-day forecast for the userâ€™s location using the APIs available at https://openweathermap.org with proper HTTP response handling.
* Today Forecast shows weather and wind direction
* Gracefully handle any communication errors, e.g. when the user is offline or a request times-out and so on..
* Employ sufficient logging in a manner that would allow a third-party logging service (e.g. Crashlytics, RayGun, DataDog etc.) to be integrated at later date without a complete overhaul.
* Continue by adding security to the application by asking the user to login. This can be through an OAuth provider of your choice, e.g. Facebook, Google etc.
* Add third tab with User Profile that contains username and logout button
* Add guest login
## Notes
* The application must be built using the native SDK and tooling for your platform. For
iOS applications, Swift 3+ must be used.
* Use Interface Builder and Auto-layouts for UI
* Use iOS architecture that works better for team development
* You are free to use any frameworks or libraries that you see fit.
